# Music-Recommendation-System
This will combine some of the functionalities I tried to implement in Python in the past 2 and a half months.

# Overview

A Python application called the Music Recommendation System was created to offer customers tailored music recommendations based on their listening habits and history. By recommending appropriate songs or playlists, the system seeks to improve user experience by applying machine learning algorithms and data analysis tools.

# Features

  User Profile Creation: Users can create profiles and input their music preferences, favorite genres, artists, and tracks.
  
  Listening History Analysis: The system analyzes users' listening history to understand their preferences and patterns.
  
  Recommendation Generation: Based on user profiles and listening history, the system generates personalized music recommendations.
  
  Integration with Music APIs: The system integrates with music streaming platforms or APIs to fetch music data and recommendations.
  
  Feedback Mechanism: Users can provide feedback on recommended tracks to further refine future recommendations.
  
  Interactive Interface: The system provides an intuitive interface for users to explore recommendations and manage their preferences.

# Structures:

Python is used in the construction of the Music Recommendation System, which makes use of the following elements:

  Data Collection: Gathers information on what listeners have liked, such as artists, genres, and tracks they've listened to most.
  
  Data preprocessing involves cleaning and preparing the gathered information for analysis.
  
  Machine Learning Models: Produces suggestions by applying machine learning techniques like content-based or collaborative filtering.
  
  Recommendation Engine: Utilizing user-profiles and past data, this engine provides customized music recommendations.
  
  User Interface: An interactive interface lets users view recommendations, adjust preferences, and communicate with the system.
  
  Integration with Music APIs: Pulls music information and suggestions from third-party APIs or streaming services.

# Installation:

To run the Music Recommendation System, follow these steps:

  Clone the repository from GitHub: (https://github.com/JohnGeo123/Music-Recommendation-System)
  
  Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
  
  Run the program using python main.py.
  
# Application:

User registration: People can register and give details about the music they like.

Listening History Analysis: To determine a user's preferences, the system examines their listening history.

Recommendation Generation: The technology provides customized music suggestions based on user profiles and listening history.

Feedback: To improve future suggestions, users can offer their thoughts on tracks that are suggested.

Examining Suggestions: Users have the option to view and add suggested songs or playlists to their playlists.
